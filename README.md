# The Quran with Verses Grouped by Clause
## English and Arabic

Each verse in the Quran contains one or more sentences. I don't see any particular reason or benefit for it to be that way. There are also no paragraphs to group related sentences. To facilitate reading and understanding the Quran, this project subdivides each verse into clauses.
